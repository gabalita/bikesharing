# Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
The visualizations show the following results:
  1) Men comprise the majority of the riders.
  2) The Citi Bike program benefits from a consistent and frequent utilization from subscribers over customers. 
  3) Both men and women use Citi Bikes to get to and from work (morning and evening hours are most utilized).
 
 These insights can be used to inform a possible program in a different city like Des Moines.
 
 Future visualizations that we could create with the dataset are:
 - Most common trips from one borough to another (e.g. Manhattan to Brooklyn, Bronx to Manhattan)
 - Bike usage over months in a year 
 - Bike usage vs temperature
